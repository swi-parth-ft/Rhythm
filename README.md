# Rhythm - Music Application of iOS
## I have build this music application called "Rhythm" using Napster API for tracks and all metadata about song and playlists like top songs, albums, greatest hits, new releases etc.

### Napster Documentation:
https://developer.prod.napster.com/api/v2.2

### In Rhythm, we are giving users 3 choices for sign in or register.
- Facebook Login
- Firebase Authentication
- Google Sign in

### Features:
- Sign up / Sign in
- Guide navigation after signing in
- Comments for any perticular song (using Firebase realtime database)
- Home Screen with all categories
- Now playing screen
- Explore Screen
- Premium Subscription screen
- Beautiful Animations
- Tab bar controller, Navigation Controller and Guide view controller

I have build this application using xcode, swift, storyboard and for designing and handsoff process I used AdobeXD and Zeplin.
